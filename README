TODO

- learn what i'm doing
- link back to gutenberg
- formatting
- automate collection of many docs?
- better checking of what is and is not a passage (eg exclude lists, headers)
- check if the embedding needs to be updated?
- pickled embedding will cross file size limit - figure out alternative?
- additional metadata, like year and translator and maybe country of origin
- Figure out streamlit
